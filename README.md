# Portfolio
Welcome to Jack Brettell's Portfolio!
This is the latest iteration of my portfolio, as 
I continue to learn more coding, my portfolio 
will continue to grow. 

## Projects
There are three projects that I have included in the portfolio.
The Kitten Insult Generator was my first group project.
I was part of a 4 person team that coordinated and created the 
app using github. The other two projects were solo projects, 
and also first attempts at using firebase, moment.js, and APIs.
